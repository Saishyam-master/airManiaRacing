}
```

**🎯 Specific Design Recommendations:**
- **Color Scheme**: Stick with cyan (#00ffff) and magenta (#ff00ff) for true neon vibes
- **Add Scanlines**: Create a retro CRT effect with CSS
- **Neon Button Upgrades**: Make buttons look like neon signs
- **Pulsing Borders**: Add animated neon borders to key elements
- **Particle System**: Add floating neon particles in the background

**💡 Key Insight on Text Overlay vs Neon Background:**
> "You're absolutely right about the text overlay approach! For the Game UI (speed, altitude, score):
> - Move to neon-styled side panels or corner displays
> - Use semi-transparent neon boxes that don't obstruct gameplay
> - Consider a heads-up display (HUD) style with neon borders
> 
> The neon background approach is definitely the way to go - it'll give your game a distinctive cyberpunk aesthetic that's much more engaging than traditional text overlays."
