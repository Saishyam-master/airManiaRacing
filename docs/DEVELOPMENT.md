## üéØ Collision Detection & Aircraft System Solutions

- **Corner Spawn**: Aircraft spawns at terrain corner for racing-style start
- **Real-time Metrics**: Speed, altitude, throttle, engine status tracking
- **Crash Detection**: Terrain collision with safety margins

### Collision Detection Options

#### Option 1: Simple but Effective Collision Detection
```javascript
// Add this to your environment.js
class CollisionSystem {
    constructor(environment) {
        this.environment = environment;
        this.raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();
    }

    checkAircraftCollision(aircraft) {
        // Get aircraft bounding box
        const aircraftBox = new THREE.Box3().setFromObject(aircraft);
        const minY = aircraftBox.min.y;
        
        // Check terrain height at aircraft position
        const terrainHeight = this.environment.getTerrainHeightAt(
            aircraft.position.x, 
            aircraft.position.z
        );
        
        // Add safety margin
        const safetyMargin = 10;
        const collisionThreshold = terrainHeight + safetyMargin;
        
        if (minY <= collisionThreshold) {
            return {
                collision: true,
                terrainHeight: terrainHeight,
                aircraftHeight: minY,
                penetration: collisionThreshold - minY
            };
        }
        
        return { collision: false };
    }

    // More accurate collision using multiple points
    checkDetailedCollision(aircraft) {
        const aircraftBox = new THREE.Box3().setFromObject(aircraft);
        
        // Test multiple points around aircraft
        const testPoints = [
            aircraft.position.clone(),
            new THREE.Vector3(aircraftBox.min.x, aircraftBox.min.y, aircraft.position.z),
            new THREE.Vector3(aircraftBox.max.x, aircraftBox.min.y, aircraft.position.z),
            new THREE.Vector3(aircraft.position.x, aircraftBox.min.y, aircraftBox.min.z),
            new THREE.Vector3(aircraft.position.x, aircraftBox.min.y, aircraftBox.max.z)
        ];

        for (let point of testPoints) {
            const terrainHeight = this.environment.getTerrainHeightAt(point.x, point.z);
            if (point.y <= terrainHeight + 5) { // 5 unit safety margin
                return {
                    collision: true,
                    point: point,
                    terrainHeight: terrainHeight,
                    aircraftHeight: point.y
                };
            }
        }
        
        return { collision: false };
    }
}
```

#### Option 2: Physics Engine Integration (Recommended)
```bash
# Add this to your project
npm install cannon-es
```

```javascript
import * as CANNON from 'cannon-es';

class PhysicsManager {
    constructor() {
        this.world = new CANNON.World();
        this.world.gravity.set(0, -9.82, 0);
        this.world.broadphase = new CANNON.NaiveBroadphase();
        this.world.solver.iterations = 10;
        
        this.terrainBody = null;
        this.aircraftBody = null;
    }

    createTerrainPhysics(terrain) {
        // Create physics body from terrain mesh
        const geometry = terrain.geometry;
        const vertices = [];
        const indices = [];
        
        // Extract vertices
        const posArray = geometry.attributes.position.array;
        for (let i = 0; i < posArray.length; i += 3) {
            vertices.push(new CANNON.Vec3(posArray[i], posArray[i + 1], posArray[i + 2]));
        }
        
        // Extract indices
        if (geometry.index) {
            const indexArray = geometry.index.array;
            for (let i = 0; i < indexArray.length; i += 3) {
                indices.push([indexArray[i], indexArray[i + 1], indexArray[i + 2]]);
            }
        }
        
        // Create trimesh shape
        const shape = new CANNON.Trimesh(vertices, indices);
        this.terrainBody = new CANNON.Body({ mass: 0 });
        this.terrainBody.addShape(shape);
        this.world.add(this.terrainBody);
    }

    createAircraftPhysics(aircraft) {
        // Create physics body for aircraft
        const shape = new CANNON.Box(new CANNON.Vec3(6, 2, 2));
        this.aircraftBody = new CANNON.Body({ mass: 1 });
        this.aircraftBody.addShape(shape);
        this.aircraftBody.position.copy(aircraft.position);
        
        // Add collision event listener
        this.aircraftBody.addEventListener('collide', (event) => {
            this.handleCollision(event);
        });
        
        this.world.add(this.aircraftBody);
    }

    handleCollision(event) {
        console.log('Aircraft collision detected!');
        this.onCrash();
    }

    onCrash() {
        console.log('CRASH!');
        // Handle crash logic: stop game, show crash animation, etc.
    }

    update(deltaTime) {
        this.world.step(deltaTime);
        
        // Update Three.js objects from physics bodies
        if (this.aircraftBody && aircraft) {
            aircraft.position.copy(this.aircraftBody.position);
            aircraft.quaternion.copy(this.aircraftBody.quaternion);
        }
    }
}
```

### Sky Dome Fix
**Issue**: Sphere geometry creates visible globe artifact  
**Solution**: Use hemisphere with proper depth settings
- Changed to hemisphere geometry (half sphere)
- Increased radius from 2000 to 5000 units
- Added `depthWrite: false` and `renderOrder: -1`
- Adjusted gradient parameters for better sky appearance

### Current Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ **Environment**: Fixed sky dome, added corner spawn positioning
- ‚úÖ **Aircraft System**: GLB model loading, physics, metrics tracking
- ‚úÖ **Main Integration**: Updated game loop to use aircraft system
- üîÑ **Collision**: Basic terrain collision implemented, physics engine ready for integration
- ‚è≥ **Racing Elements**: Awaiting collision system finalization
