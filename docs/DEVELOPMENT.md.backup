# Air Mania Racing - Development Documentation

## Project Overview
A flight racing game built with Three.js and modern web technologies. This documentation tracks the development progress and workflow used throughout the project.

## üîÑ Development Workflow with CodeRabbit

### Initial Setup (Completed)
1. ‚úÖ Initialize local Git repository
2. ‚úÖ Create GitHub repository: `airManiaRacing`
3. ‚úÖ Push initial code to `main` branch
4. ‚úÖ Set up development environment with Vite

### Branch-Based Development Workflow

#### 1. Feature Development Process
```bash
# Step 1: Start from main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Step 2: Create new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/branch-name
# Examples:
# - feature/aircraft-physics
# - feature/race-track
# - feature/ui-improvements
# - bugfix/camera-controls
```

#### 2. Development Cycle
```bash
# Make your changes and commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat: descriptive commit message"

# Push branch to GitHub
git push -u origin feature/branch-name
```

#### 3. Pull Request & Review Process
1. **Create Pull Request** on GitHub
   - Base branch: `main`
   - Compare branch: `feature/branch-name`
   - Add descriptive title and description
   
2. **CodeRabbit Review**
   - CodeRabbit will automatically review the PR
   - Address any suggestions or issues
   - Make additional commits if needed
   
3. **Merge Process**
   ```bash
   # After PR approval, merge to main
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git branch -d feature/branch-name  # Delete local branch
   git push origin --delete feature/branch-name  # Delete remote branch
   ```

### üìù Commit Message Conventions
Follow conventional commits for better documentation:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation updates
- `style:` - Code style changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add realistic aircraft physics with lift and drag"
git commit -m "fix: camera following aircraft smoothly"
git commit -m "docs: update development workflow documentation"
```

## üöÄ Quick Reference Commands

### Starting New Feature
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Daily Development
```bash
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your changes"
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### After PR Merge
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
```
