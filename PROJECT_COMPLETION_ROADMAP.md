## 📁 Current Working Files Status

### ✅ Ready to Use (No Changes Needed)
- `main.js` - Game initialization and main loop
- `environment.js` - Terrain and lighting system
- `audio.js` - Sound management
- `particles.js` - Visual effects system
- `physics.js` - Base physics utilities

### 🔧 Needs Completion (High Priority)
- `aircraft-system.js` - **90% complete** - just needs crash detection
- `controls.js` - **Complete** - working controls
- `ui.js` - **50% complete** - needs HUD implementation
- `config.js` - **80% complete** - needs race settings

### 🆕 New Files Needed
- `track-system.js` - **Started** - checkpoint and collision system
- `race-manager.js` - Race logic and timing
- `checkpoint.js` - Individual checkpoint objects
- `crash-effects.js` - Crash detection and visual effects

---

## ⚡ Fastest Path to Completion

### Day 1: Core Game Loop
```javascript
// Priority order:
1. Fix aircraft-system.js crash detection
2. Implement basic track-system.js
3. Create race-manager.js
4. Basic UI updates
```

### Day 2: Racing Features
```javascript
// Priority order:
1. Checkpoint collision detection
2. Lap timing system
3. Simple track layout
4. Audio integration
```

### Day 3: Polish & Deploy
```javascript
// Priority order:
1. Performance optimization
2. Visual polish
3. Bug fixes
4. Deployment setup
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Strategy

### Minimal Viable Game Features
1. **Aircraft flies smoothly** ✅ (Done)
2. **Checkpoints detect aircraft** (3 hours work)
3. **Lap timing works** (2 hours work)
4. **Basic UI shows progress** (4 hours work)
5. **Crash detection resets** (2 hours work)

### Code Reuse Strategy
- Use existing physics system (no changes needed)
- Leverage current controls (working perfectly)
- Build on stable Three.js foundation
- Implement CodeRabbit's optimization suggestions

### Quick Wins
- **Track System**: Use simple Box3 collision detection
- **Checkpoints**: Ring-shaped geometries with raycasting
- **UI**: Update existing HUD elements
- **Audio**: Use Web Audio API with existing audio.js

## 🔄 Git Workflow for Fast Development

### Daily Workflow
```bash
# Morning: Start fresh
git checkout feature/final-game
git pull origin main-clean

# Work on features
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement [feature]"

# Evening: Backup progress
git push origin feature/final-game
```

### CodeRabbit Integration
