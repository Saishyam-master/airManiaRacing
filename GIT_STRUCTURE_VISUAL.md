## Current Status

### ✅ COMPLETED TODAY
- Fixed banking axis drift with quaternion rotation
- Eliminated double sensitivity (1.92% → 9.6% input)
- Decoupled banking physics from nose movement
- Created clean git structure preserving CodeRabbit docs
- Established fast-track completion roadmap

### 🚀 ACTIVE BRANCH: `feature/final-game`
**Ready for racing features implementation**

### 📊 DEVELOPMENT APPROACH
- **Speed**: Use existing stable foundation
- **Quality**: Implement CodeRabbit recommendations
- **Documentation**: Preserve all AI interactions
- **Timeline**: 7 days to production-ready game

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Day 1 (Today): Core Racing
1. **Track System** - Simple checkpoint collision detection
2. **Race Manager** - Lap timing and scoring
3. **UI Updates** - HUD for race progress
4. **Crash Detection** - Reset functionality

### Day 2: Game Features  
1. **Audio Integration** - Engine sounds and feedback
2. **Visual Effects** - Particles and polish
3. **Multiple Tracks** - Basic track variations
4. **Performance Optimization** - CodeRabbit suggestions

### Day 3: Production Ready
1. **Bug Fixes** - Final testing and fixes
2. **Deployment Setup** - Build optimization
3. **Documentation** - Final docs and blog content
4. **Launch** - Production deployment

## Branch Protection

### 🔒 Protected Branches
- `backup/coderabbit-archive` - NEVER modify (blog content)
- `backup/working-features` - NEVER modify (code safety)
- `main-clean` - Only merge from feature/final-game

### 🔄 Active Development
- `feature/final-game` - All new development here
- Daily commits with clear messages
- Regular pushes to backup progress

## Success Strategy

### ⚡ Fast Implementation
- Build on working aircraft system (no physics changes needed)
- Use Three.js built-in collision detection
- Leverage existing UI framework
- Apply CodeRabbit's performance recommendations

### 📝 Documentation Preservation
- All CodeRabbit interactions archived
- Technical solutions documented
- Development process recorded
- Blog-ready content maintained

### 🎯 Production Focus
- MVP features only (racing game essentials)
- Performance optimization from day 1
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile-friendly design

## Git Commands for Daily Work

```bash
# Start each day
git checkout feature/final-game
git pull origin feature/final-game

# During development
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement [specific feature]"

# End each day  
git push origin feature/final-game

# Weekly backup
git checkout backup/working-features
git merge feature/final-game --no-ff
git push origin backup/working-features
```

---

**Result**: Clean, organized development with preserved documentation and fast path to production-ready game.
