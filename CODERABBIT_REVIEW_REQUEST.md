# CodeRabbit Review Request

**Purpose**: Request comprehensive code review of recently merged features

## üîç Code Review Needed For:

### Recently Merged Features (Commit: 6bf2033)
- **Banking Controls System** (`aircraft-system.js`, `controls.js`)
  - Banking physics with turn rate calculations
  - Control separation (W/S throttle, A/D banking, arrows pitch)
  - Input handling and responsiveness

- **4x World Scaling** (`environment.js`)
  - Terrain scaling from 4,000 to 16,000 units
  - Skybox scaling to 20,000 units
  - Shadow and fog scaling adjustments

- **Debug Grid System** (`grid.js`)
  - Comprehensive 3D coordinate system
  - Invisible by default with toggle controls
  - Global debug controls (`window.gridDebug`)

- **Architecture Cleanup** (`main.js`)
  - Module integration and initialization
  - Clean imports and dependencies

## üéØ Specific Review Focus Areas

### Performance & Optimization
- [ ] Three.js geometry and material efficiency
- [ ] Animation loop performance (especially grid pulsing)
- [ ] Memory management and cleanup

### Code Quality & Best Practices
- [ ] ES6+ modern JavaScript usage
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Documentation and code comments
- [ ] Naming conventions and consistency

### Flight Physics & Game Logic
- [ ] Banking angle calculations and turn rates
- [ ] Control responsiveness and sensitivity
- [ ] Collision detection with scaled terrain
- [ ] Aircraft positioning and movement

### Architecture & Maintainability
- [ ] Module separation and dependencies
- [ ] Configuration management
- [ ] Debug system integration
- [ ] Scalability considerations

## üêõ Known Issues to Validate
- Minor arrow key pitch responsiveness (documented in DEVELOPMENT.md)
- Grid system performance with all visual elements
- Terrain collision detection at 4x scale

## üìù Request
@coderabbitai Please review the merged code for:
1. **Code quality issues** and potential bugs
2. **Performance optimizations** for Three.js rendering
3. **Best practices** improvements
4. **Security considerations** (especially global window objects)
5. **Architecture suggestions** for better maintainability
